<p>
    <h7>Good evening, Bellingham and surrounding this is Mr. Hysteria bringing you Highway Obscura. Each week I take you on a trip across America’s Interstates and tell you the unusual, mundane, or straight up weird roadside attractions you’ll find there. Take a trip with me to see the strange sites that lurk between dark stretches of road where time flies by at about 65 mph.... 

    <br><br>We're starting off in Bellingham, WA at the corner of E Oak and High, heading towards I-5. We're going to Seattle for our friend's show at El Corazon. Her band is headlining you know isn't that cool, you remember when they'd practice in our dorm and annoy the hell out of the neighbors? Let's hurry up and get on our way, I want to make a couple stops and take some pictures. And don't worry about music, I've got a mix of all local, up-and-coming bands ready for us. Spirits high, gas tank questionable, ETA 11:00 PM on the dot. This is show #6 of Highway Obscura.

                Perhaps the most notorious statue of WWU, <em>He Who Used to Hunt Cougars for Bounty</em> by Richard Beyer was proudly displayed on Old Main lawn until it was quietly relocated to the woods last summer. Carved from white granite, it was created in 1972 and with the help of an assistant, was created in three months. It's based on a local Bellingham legend about a man who used to hunt, but took up whiskey instead. The man and cougar meet again and drink together, reconciling with song and embrace. Consider it a  commentary on the respect that man and nature must have for each other, although WWU students will say otherwise.

I can't believe they moved that sculpture; I miss seeing it every day. How much did they spend to lift it out of the ground and hide it away in the woods? And dude did you seriously not get gas before this? We're gonna have to stop in Everett. <br><br> Anyways this is Gallowmaker and they're from Bellingham too. We should see them next time they're at The Shakedown. They call themselves "surfy deathrock". I hope there's no Everett traffic. I swear whenever I leave I always get stuck in Everett.

            <h7>Forget Area 51, who would've thought Everett would be so lucky to have their very own UFO. Everett locals have not reported an increase in alien life form sightings since its arrival. It touched down in Paine Field Community Park in 2008, so we think maybe they heard about the recession and dipped. How they left we do not know, but maybe they were assisted by Peter Reiquam, who constructed "Landing Zone".

            What are the odds there's a UFO across from the gas station. If we had that, maybe we wouldn't be missing the opener right now. You think UFOs run on gas too? I think they're past that, it's probably something not even on our Planet and that's why it's still here, they didn't have enough to get back. Ok yeah, since you bought dinner I'll get the gas. This is Bad Optics, prog post-punk out of Everett. They also call it "shamewave".

            We gotta get going or we'll miss the whole thing and be deemed The Worst Friends Ever on Any Planet. I can't shake a title like that. Step on it!

                When Edith Macefield refused to sell her house to the city for $1 million, they built a five-story mall around it. The real <em>Up</em> house stands its ground in Seattle. The 108 year old farmhouse is now abandoned, far away from the time it was bought by Macefield for $3,750 in 1952. Edith Macefield passed away in 2008 at age 86, leaving the house to a construction manager she had befriended who then sold it to fund his kid's education, as per her wishes.

               <br><br> I respect that kind of lifelong stubborness (as she should!). Too many historic buildings thrown away for big malls and stuff. That house could use a little TLC though.
               <br><br>
               Black Ends is Gunk Pop. They're from Seattle but they play all over. Nicolle, Billie, and Ben are so great live and really have their own sound. We should listen to "My Own Dead" next. That's El Corazon it's the building with the big clown on the front. Man I'm so glad we weren't too late, this is gonna be so cool.

    We pull into the parking lot of El Corazon. Thankfully your buddy's set is last so we'll catch the tail end, but maybe if we hadn't made so many stops we could've caught the whole thing... 
    <br><br>They played a great set. Now we're gonna stick around here for a week, but I can't wait to see what we'll find on the way back. I'll see you then. Thank you for joining me on our trip through I-5 of all-local music and musings. Highway Obscura is here every week to bring you a mix of fresh and familiar tracks and roadside attractions along the way. See you next time, this is Mr. Hysteria signing off.
