    Hi, I’m Katie! I’m a Seattle-based Designer pursuing a Design BFA at Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA. Now in my Junior year, I have found a love for many aspects of design with specific interest in editorial print, motion, and UI. I love a hands-on approach and taking things outside of the computer for personal, tactile touches. 

    <br>Outside of design, I'm a climber, analog media devotee, 90s TV fan, and music obsessed- whether it be sleuthing out shows or manning the board for my favorite radio station. (Ask me why you should listen to the radio...).  

    <br>My favorite movies are The Shawshank Redemption, The Graduate, and But I’m A Cheerleader. These have been top of my list since I was 16 and I’m not sure when that will change. Yesterday I watched Wallace and Gromit’s A Vengeance Most Fowl and it was really good, but maybe not in my top 3 films ever watched. I love Claymation though; seeing the fingerprints on the characters as they move reminds you of how special and handmade it is as a process.
